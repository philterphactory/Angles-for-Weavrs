In two weeks in May 2012 I created the code in [Angles For
Weavrs](https://github.com/philterphactory/Angles-for-Weavrs). It's a
mixture of Python/Django and Java code that creates a graph
visualisation of a Weavr's keyword usage over the preceding week. This
document records the process of creating the code.
